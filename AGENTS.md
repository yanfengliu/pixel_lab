# AGENTS.md — pixel_lab

## What this is

Browser-based tool for slicing 2D pixel-art sprite sheets and animated GIFs into game-ready animation frames, with built-in pixel drawing tools.

Engine-agnostic export: atlas PNG + JSON manifest + per-frame PNGs bundled as a ZIP; projects save and reopen as self-contained `.pixellab.json`. Runs entirely in the browser — files never leave the machine.

Stack: Vite + TypeScript + React + Zustand + Vitest.

## Fleet constitution

- Verify visual work visually: capture the rendered result — screenshot, frame, recording — and look at it, because a passing test says nothing about what the pixels do. Work with no visual surface runs headlessly. One framing is not a check: sweep several camera angles and zoom levels, since a defect the chosen view happens to hide is the normal case. Confirming the change you made is only half of it: every task ends with a sweep of the whole rendered result, looking for what is wrong rather than for what you touched. Defects hide in the parts nobody was working on, and the ones a user finds first are almost always there.
- A defect the user reports is recorded and gated, never only fixed: an entry in `docs/learning/defect-register.md` — symptom as they saw it, investigation, root cause, and how it is checked from now on — plus a check that covers the defect's whole class rather than the one instance. Unlike a lesson, the entry stays after it becomes a gate: the register is the standing list of what the gates could not see, which is where the next defect comes from.
- Commit each verified unit of change to `main` without being asked, and push. Gates pass before any commit that touches code; a dependency change re-runs the audit gate.
- A push is finished when the remote gate says so, not when the remote accepts it: watch the run to a conclusion, and read the run's status at session start before taking new work. A red remote gate is the next task — ahead of whatever was planned — because everything built on top of it is built on an unknown. The local gate and the remote gate run on different machines, and only the remote one is what a collaborator, a consumer, or a release sees. Voxel's `main` last saw a green CI run on 2026-07-24 and went five weeks without another — **131 pushes, 100 of them failing and 31 cancelled** — every one behind a green local gate, until the user reported it. The browser suite failed only on machines slower than the author's, and every machine that runs it in CI is slower than the author's.
- A repo chooses its own language and toolchain — Node, Python, and Rust all run here. Each pins its version where its own tooling reads it (`.nvmrc`, `requires-python`, `rust-toolchain.toml`) and names it in Gates, so a version mismatch is not read as a code failure. Node repos baseline at 24; an older major keeps a CI job proving it.
- Runtime model calls are authorized and already paid for — this fleet has one user, with Claude Code and Codex subscriptions — so a program here may call a model at runtime, vision included.
- The top reasoning tier is rationed: spend it only on the hardest problem, or on directing the workhorse tier that does the work — and only at maximum effort or orchestration.
- Two failed attempts at one problem escalate to the hard-problem skill: a search across deliberately different approaches, run to a result rather than to a report. Spending real budget there is authorized — a third pass at the approach that already failed is the expensive mistake. Return the working result, or the strongest proved part with its exact remaining gap.
- High-risk work — persistence/migrations, security/auth, concurrency, money, supply chain, edits that reach sibling repos — escalates to the multi-cli-review skill. That is a review you run yourself, not permission you ask the user for; nothing in this canon requires asking.
- Error messages are a product surface: audit them as a class, including paths the task did not touch. Each names what happened, which input caused it, and what would satisfy it — never a bare `Validation failed`.
- When blocked, hand over the raw artifact — screenshot, rendered page, log line, data row — as soon as the blocker is named rather than after the analysis: your description of it is filtered through the misunderstanding that caused the block, so it cannot contain what you failed to notice.
- Task-run evidence lives only under ignored paths and is deleted once nothing active needs it; it enters Git only when review promotes it into a repository input — a fixture, golden, snapshot, or contract. Tracked docs keep conclusions and provenance only. Blob ceilings for anything promoted: over 256 KiB needs a stated reason, over 512 KiB binary or 1 MiB of anything never enters ordinary Git, and an asset store or LFS needs the user's approval.
- Write prose one line per paragraph (no hard wrapping).
- Keep a devlog: one short dated line per behaviour-changing session in `docs/devlog/summary.md`, newest first, and a section in `docs/devlog/detailed/` for anything a later session could trip over — what was believed and proved false, what a reviewer caught that the author missed, what number moved and from what. It is history, not status. Both shapes are in `../fleet/docs/devlog-template.md`.
- A lesson ships WITH the gate that prevents its recurrence, in the same commit, and then the prose is DELETED — a written lesson is a staging area, never a destination. Three buckets and no permanent index: gateable knowledge lives in the gate's own header (a test, a lint rule, a schema check, a fixed command), where it is read at the moment it matters; knowledge with no mechanical trigger — "verify the instrument before trusting the measurement" — is promoted into this constitution, which every session reads at start; anything that fits neither was folklore and is dropped. A lessons index that only grows is a list of things that failed to graduate, paid for by a read every session: aoe2 reached 84 entries, none naming a gate, while recording the same mistake twice under two headings and repeating a written-down lesson three times in one session. The defect register is the exception and stays — it is the standing list of what the gates could NOT see, which is where the next defect comes from.
- Read `docs/learning/lessons.md` at session start: the one-line index of what this repo has already paid to learn, with each entry's war story and anchor in `lessons-evidence.md`. A lesson lands the session it is learned, anchored to a measurement, commit, or test id; unanchored, it is folklore. When a lesson becomes a gate — a test, a lint rule, a fixed command — delete both halves. Shape: `../fleet/docs/lessons-template.md`.
- Every unit of work gets an independent harsh critic before it is called done — a subagent that did not do the work, given the diff, the claim, and the measurement, and asked to find why the measurement does not support the claim. Hard problems get several with deliberately different lenses. This is not a courtesy pass: every multi-lane review run so far has found a defect the author missed, including three in a cache its author had already gated and mutation-tested.
- Verify the instrument before trusting the measurement, because a critic is a backstop and not the first line. Confirm the flag took effect, the denominator is the population you meant, the control reproduces, and the claim you are relying on is still true rather than remembered. A whole session's conclusions were built on labels chosen with knowledge of the future, agreement quoted over a population that was 99.8% forced no-ops, a `--eval-episodes` flag silently ignored so every checkpoint was picked by a five-sample lottery, and a review lane declared unavailable from a three-week-old memory that was wrong. Each was one command away from being caught.

- A standing loop takes its next task from exercising the artifact the way its user does — at the default entry point, in the real configuration — and sweeping the whole result, not from reading code for something to improve. Each repo names its own entry point in `docs/policies/local-rules.md`.
- A standing loop spans context compactions: finish the unit, commit it, take the next. A compaction is not a stopping point, and there is no handoff to a fresh session.

- Delegation has a measured price: one general-purpose subagent averages **~350k tokens** (observed 240k-460k), because it re-reads the canon and its source files from scratch and its own critics and gate runs multiply that. A dozen agents in one session cost ~3.5M tokens and burned a week's quota of the top tier in a day (2026-09-02), tripping the session limit twice and killing every agent's in-flight work mid-task. Budget agents like a rationed resource, not like parallelism that is free.
- Run **one agent at a time** by default; two only when both are long, genuinely independent, and touch different files. Concurrency does not merely multiply tokens: agents sharing a machine fight over the dev server, the sibling build and the CPU, and their retries cost more than the parallelism saves — three merges aborted on a shared-dist race in one session, and two agents' `git stash` calls crossed and deleted each other's work.
- Delegate only what needs a **fresh context window**: an independent critic, a multi-file implementation with its own TDD loop, a search across deliberately different approaches. Everything else stays in the parent — merges, gate runs, version bumps, changelog edits, reading a file, running a script. An agent spun up to run a command costs a thousand times what the command costs.
- Give an agent the **answer, not the search**. Every fact the parent already knows — file paths and line numbers, the root cause, the measured numbers, the version to use, what is already on disk — goes in the brief. An agent left to rediscover a root cause pays for the whole investigation a second time.
- A killed agent's **worktree survives**; its transcript does not. Relaunch into the existing worktree with a brief that names what is already there and what remains, so the work is finished rather than redone.
- The critic stays: every multi-lane review so far found a defect the author missed, and one that blocked a shipped release. But one critic per unit of work, given the diff and the claim — a lane per dimension is for high-risk work only.
- Treat the quota like a gate: past roughly **1M agent tokens in a session**, stop fanning out and finish what is already open.

- Steering compounds: a direction that outlives the immediate task lands that same session — `../fleet/FLEET.md` if fleet-wide, else this repo's `docs/policies/local-rules.md` — and you say where it went.
- Reviewer model pins live only in `../fleet/docs/skills/multi-cli-review.md`; a model a product itself calls is pinned in the repo that calls it. Never hardcode a model ID anywhere else.
<!-- FLEET-CANON:END -->

## Gates

`npm test` · `npm run typecheck` · `npm run build` — all three before every code commit; only affected tests while iterating. There is no lint script; `npm run smoke` (drawing smoke test) exists as an extra check. Dependency audit gate: `npm audit --audit-level=high` (full tree and `--omit=dev`).

## Session start

Read `docs/devlog/summary.md` and `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` before starting work.

## Invariants & boundaries

- TDD for behavior changes: tests first, testing the contract (app experience and mechanisms), not the code.
- File size: keep every file under 500 LOC (hard ceiling 1000) — split god-objects by lifecycle/role.

## Conventions

- Devlog: `docs/devlog/summary.md` (one line per task; compact past 50 lines) + `docs/devlog/detailed/START_DATE_END_DATE.md` (per-task entry; archive via `git mv` when the active file passes 500 lines, starting a new file dated today).
- Changelog `docs/changelog.md` + `package.json` version (external audience, migration focus): bump `c` per non-breaking change, `b` (reset `c`) per breaking change, `a` only when the user says so; one bump per coherent shipped change; pure refactors/doc sweeps bump nothing.
- Architecture: structural changes update `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` and append a row to `docs/architecture/drift-log.md`; non-obvious tradeoffs append to `docs/architecture/decisions.md` (append-only — supersede, never delete); non-structural fixes touch none of these.
- Lessons: `docs/learning/lessons.md` per the fleet evidence-anchor rule; code lessons need a real test node id.
- Review threads: syntheses land in `docs/threads/current/<objective>/<date>/<n>/REVIEW.md` (synthesis only — no raw CLI output; temp captures go to gitignored `tmp/review-runs/`; the legacy iteration under `docs/threads/done/full/` keeps its `raw/` files); move the objective to `docs/threads/done/` when closed.
- Design specs and plans live under `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
- README updates when public surface or user-visible features change.
