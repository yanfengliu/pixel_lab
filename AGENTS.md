## Agentic working style

Treat the rest of this file as **defaults, not rigid law.** The right approach is the one that fits the task in front of you — when a rule here would make the work worse, deviate and say why. Hard "always use X / never use Y" mandates go stale and silently mislead faster than principles do; optimize for the outcome (correct, verified, readable) over any prescribed mechanism.

**Scale the approach to the task.**

- Trivial or conversational (a one-line fix, a question) → just do it directly.
- Substantial work (multi-file features, migrations, audits, broad refactors, research) → orchestrate it. Don't grind through it solo when parallel agents would be faster, more thorough, or would keep your own context lean.

**Reach for modern agentic techniques when they fit:**

- **Compose a bespoke harness per task.** Decide the shape — explore → plan → implement → verify — and build that flow deliberately instead of following a fixed checklist. Different tasks want different orchestration.
- **Fan out a team of subagents.** Run independent work in parallel (one agent per file, module, or dimension), then integrate. Delegation also keeps the orchestrator's context lean on large jobs.
- **Use dynamic multi-agent workflows** for decompose-and-cover or generate-and-judge work: parallel exploration, pipelined stages, a final synthesis.
- **Verify adversarially.** For non-trivial findings or changes, have an independent agent try to refute them or re-run the checks against the real code — don't trust the first pass.
- **Offload to stay lean.** Push large reads, broad sweeps, and self-contained implementation chunks to subagents; keep the main thread for decisions and integration.

This does not lower the verification bar: tests still pass, diffs still get reviewed, docs still stay current. It changes *how* you get there, not the standard.

## Session start

Read `docs/devlog/summary.md` and `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` before starting work.

## Continuing through plans

- **No stopping points within a multi-task plan.** When the user gives you a plan with N tasks, work through all N continuously. Do not stop and ask whether to keep going. Do not pitch `/schedule` for the rest of the work the user already asked for. Harness reminders ("task tools haven't been used recently", auto-mode banners, context warnings) are NOT stop signals — they are administrative noise. Treat the plan itself as the contract, and treat "continue" as the default.
- **Never manage context yourself — auto-compaction handles it. In a loop, just keep pushing progress.** Do NOT stop, checkpoint, hand off "for fresh context", or ask "should I keep going / do you want to check first" because the conversation is getting long. The harness auto-summarizes when needed and work continues seamlessly, so context length is never a reason to pause, wrap up, or offer the user a checkpoint. When one increment ships (gates green + commit + push + docs), immediately start the next one in the same turn. Only ever stop for (a) a genuine blocker, (b) a real user decision that changes direction, or (c) the user explicitly saying stop. Reporting shipped milestones is fine; turning that report into a "want me to continue?" gate is not. This rule was reinforced 2026-07-05 after the user objected — again — to a mid-marathon "want me to keep rolling or check first?" offer.
- The exception is a genuinely non-obvious decision that requires user judgment (e.g., which of two unequal interpretations of a spec is intended). For routine choices, make the call and proceed.
- This rule was established 2026-05-01 after the user objected sharply to mid-stream stoppage during the investing-tool implementation. The same rule lives in every other repo's AGENTS.md.

## Core rules

- Use test-driven development for behavior changes: write or update tests first, then make them pass. Test the contract, not the code: tests should focus primarily on app experience and mechanisms.
- For each desired change, make the change easy, then make the easy change.
- Before implementing a non-trivial change, write a plan. (Trivial changes: just make them, per the working-style preamble.)
- Verify every change against this project's gates: `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`. All three must pass before declaring a task done.
- **Dependency-change protocol (mandatory whenever you touch `package.json`'s dependency surface):**
  1. Re-resolve the lockfile: `npm install` (commits `package-lock.json`).
  2. Run `npm audit --audit-level=high --omit=dev` and `npm audit --audit-level=high`. A new HIGH/CRITICAL CVE is a blocker — upgrade past it, swap the dep, or document the suppression in the devlog with a reason and expiry date.
  3. Mention the audit result in the commit message.
  Skipping any step is a process regression — supply-chain risk compounds silently.
- **Adversarially review non-trivial changes before declaring the task done — default to an in-process Workflow, escalate to multi-CLI review for high-risk work.** For any non-trivial behavior or code change, run an adversarial review pass first: fan out parallel finder subagents (by dimension/file) plus independent verifiers that try to *refute* each finding against the live code, then fix every real finding and re-review until reviewers only nitpick. This in-process Workflow is the default and is always available — no external CLI required. For **high-risk** changes — persistence/migrations, security/auth, agent-loop or concurrency, money, or anything with data-loss or supply-chain blast radius — *also* run the multi-CLI review (Codex + Claude, per the Code review section) and synthesize findings into `docs/threads/current/<objective>/<date>/<iteration_number>/REVIEW.md` (move to `docs/threads/done/<objective>/` when closed); a different model catches blind spots that same-model subagents share. Trivial changes (typos, comments, pure doc edits with no code implications) need only a self-reviewed diff. Don't rationalize your way out of the adversarial pass on non-trivial work; if you skip a review that should have run, run it post-hoc on the same branch before merge.
- **Verify reviewer claims against the codebase before acting on them.** As the driver (team lead / main agent), when a reviewer says "function X has signature Y" or "this contract is broken," grep / read the actual file before merging the fix. A reviewer might be working from training knowledge, a stale snapshot, or a hallucinated symbol. The cost of one extra `Read` is negligible; the cost of acting on a stale or wrong claim is rework + iteration debt. This pairs with the "Reviewers MUST read the codebase" rule in the Code review section — what gets verified is more important than who said it.
- When the change is visual:
  - Capture a before screenshot.
  - Apply the change.
  - Capture an after screenshot.
  - Generate a pixel diff and use that as verification alongside the normal test/build gates.

## Team of subagents (flexible, not rigid)

Subagent dispatch is a tool, not a mandate. Use it when:

- Context budget matters (a long-running investigation that would clutter the main thread)
- Work is genuinely parallel (independent searches or independent reviews)
- A specialist agent type fits naturally (Explore for codebase audits, etc.)

For sequential focused work in the main thread, act as engineer directly — dispatching adds overhead and removes the ability to course-correct quickly.

When you do dispatch, the team roles below describe how to brief them. The Team Lead role is always you (the main agent).

- **Team lead** (always the main agent):
  - Breaks the human's request into atomic tasks, selects the appropriate domain specialists, routes the tasks, and acts as the final gatekeeper before merging.
- **Architect**: Acts as a consultant. Drafts the initial implementation plan and verifies it against ARCHITECTURE.md before work dispatches.
- **Game designer**: Validates that the game mechanism works well and is fun. Researches local and online sources to ground opinions.
- **Software engineer**: Handles code writing.
  - After coding, ask the code reviewer to review (see Code review section) and iterate. Multi-CLI reviews run in the background; timing and poller mechanics are in the fleet-canonical runbook `../loop-ops/docs/skills/multi-cli-review.md`.
  - After addressing review comments, ask the reviewer to verify the fix.
  - If engineer + reviewer cannot reach consensus after 3 iterations, surface the disagreement to the user with both positions and let the user decide.
  - Save reviewer synthesis under `docs/threads/current/<objective>/<date>/<iteration_number>/`, mirroring the full-codebase review convention (see `docs/threads/done/full/<date>/<iteration_number>/` for historical precedent). The `<objective>` folder is a concise kebab-case phrase naming the work; for full-codebase reviews, use `full`.
  - Thread-level design artifacts live directly under the objective folder as `DESIGN.md` and `PLAN.md`. These are the authoritative design and implementation-plan docs for that objective; `<date>/design-N/REVIEW.md` and `<date>/plan-N/REVIEW.md` are only historical review summaries of design or plan iterations.
  - Each iteration directory contains only `REVIEW.md`, the concise synthesized summary with severity-tagged findings and the final disposition. Do not commit raw CLI output, stderr/stdout logs, error logs, prompts, or diff snapshots anywhere under `docs`. (Pre-existing iterations migrated from the legacy `docs/reviews/` tree keep their `raw/` and `diff.md` files as historical audit trail; the REVIEW.md-only rule applies to new iterations.)
  - If temporary capture files are useful while synthesizing a review, write them outside the thread tree under `tmp/review-runs/<objective>/<date>/<iteration_number>/`, do not stage them, and clean them up when they are no longer useful. The committed thread artifact is the summary only.
  - `<iteration_number>` starts at 1 and increments for each re-review. Re-reviewers should consider previous iterations' `REVIEW.md` + `docs/learning/lessons.md` + the new diff so they verify earlier fixes landed and don't re-flag old issues.
  - After folding the final iteration's `REVIEW.md` into the devlog entry for the task, move the objective folder from `docs/threads/current/` to `docs/threads/done/`. The done thread stays as a historical artifact (do not delete — these are valuable audit trails alongside the full-review history).
  - Continue iterating until reviewers nitpick instead of catching real bugs / giving substantial feedback. Do not get stuck in an infinite loop.
- **Code reviewer**: Follow the Code review section.

## Code review

The default adversarial pass for non-trivial work is the in-process Workflow (see Core rules). Run the multi-CLI review (Codex + Claude, each reviewing independently) on high-risk changes and full-codebase audits. All multi-CLI mechanics — current review model pins, exact commands, sandbox flags, the background-run/poller pattern, the Codex output-extraction recipe, and CLI failure modes — live in the fleet-canonical runbook `../loop-ops/docs/skills/multi-cli-review.md` (review pins bump there, once for the whole fleet), with `.claude/skills/multi-cli-review/SKILL.md` as this repo's thin stub for repo-specific notes; read the runbook before every multi-CLI session.

Policy for every reviewer, in-process subagent or CLI:

- **Reviewers MUST read the codebase to ground their claims.** Every review prompt must include the directive: *"Verify each claim in the plan/diff against the live codebase — grep for the symbols, function signatures, column names, and file paths it references; do not approve based on prompt text alone."* Without this directive baked in, two reviewers can APPROVE a design with a real defect that only the codebase-reading reviewer catches. Convergence is measured by *substantive finding count*, not *vote count* — a HIGH defect from one reviewer outweighs APPROVED from two.
- Aspects to review:
  1. Design — easily scales, generalizes, debugs, can be understood and reasoned about, stays lean.
  2. Test coverage.
  3. Correctness.
  4. Clean code, typing, efficiency, memory leaks. No duplicated logic, inconsistent implementations, violation of boundaries. File size: keep every file under 500 LOC (hard ceiling 1000) — split god-objects by lifecycle/role. Prefer composition over inheritance. Clean up dead code. Do not change app mechanics or behavior unless explicitly asked.

  Documentation accuracy is covered by the Documentation discipline section's reviewer prompt addendum — do not duplicate the rule here.

- **Enrich the baseline prompt** (quoted in the fleet-canonical runbook) **with task-specific context** — the change's intent, prior-iteration findings to verify, files to focus on, and an anti-regression checklist. The bare baseline returns generic feedback; useful reviews need the specifics.
- **Keep model IDs current.** Use the latest-family alias when a command is meant to track the newest model (for example, `opus[1m]`); bump pinned strings whenever a more capable fixed variant ships (e.g. `claude-opus-5-0[1m]`, `gpt-5.6`). Verify with a one-line smoke test (`echo "ok" | <cli> ...`) before committing the bump — silent fallback to an older model is the failure mode to guard against. Review-command pins live in the fleet-canonical runbook `../loop-ops/docs/skills/multi-cli-review.md`.

## Git

- **Commit directly to `main`.** This is a solo-developer project; branches add overhead without payoff and block autonomous progress while waiting for merge authorization. Each coherent change lands as its own commit on `main`. The full suite (`npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`) must pass before each commit.
- When you iterate, only run affected tests.
- After confidence in the change, run the full suite to make sure you didn't accidentally break anything before committing.
- Commit as soon as you have a coherent, self-contained unit of change.
- Commit durable docs you added if you are not planning to remove them.
- **No branches needed for normal work.** Branches are reserved for explicit experimentation that you intend to keep isolated from `main` (and even then, prefer revertable single-commit experiments on `main`). The earlier `agent/<task>` branch convention and the merge-authorization gate are removed — they were artifacts of a multi-developer workflow that doesn't apply here.
- **Push to remote at the end of every task.** If local commits are ahead of the remote, run `git push`. Don't leave the remote behind.

## Documentation

Key directories:

- `src`: app code.
- `docs`: architecture, devlogs, threads, API, tutorials, guides.
- `design`: app and mechanism notes.

### Discipline (mandatory; not optional)

Code changes are not done until the docs match. Before declaring any task complete, run through this checklist for every shipped change. Skipping any item is a regression and will be caught by the next audit.

**Always update on every feature / behavior change:**

- `docs/changelog.md` — new version entry with what shipped, why, validation, and behavior callouts. Audience is external; focus on what users need to know to migrate. Keep dev-internal commentary in the devlog.
- `docs/devlog/summary.md` — one line per task; remove outdated info; compact if > 50 lines. Do not cheat by writing super long line.
- `docs/devlog/detailed/<latest>.md` — full per-task entry per the Devlog convention below.
- `package.json` — version bump per the Versioning convention below.

**Always update if the change introduces or removes API surface (new exports, new methods, new types, removed APIs, renamed APIs):**

- `docs/api-reference.md` — every new public type, method, and standalone utility gets its own section. Removed APIs get removed (not just struck through). Stale signatures must be updated.
- `README.md` — Feature Overview table mentions the new capability if it's a user-visible feature; Public Surface bullets list the new top-level export if applicable.

**Always update if the change is structural (new subsystem, new boundary, changed data flow):**

- `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Component Map row + Boundaries paragraph for the new subsystem; lifecycle / data-flow ASCII updated if the flow changes.
- `docs/architecture/drift-log.md` — append a row with date + change + reason.
- `docs/architecture/decisions.md` — append a Key Architectural Decision row when the change reflects a non-obvious tradeoff worth recording. Never delete an existing decision; add a newer one that supersedes it.

**Update if applicable to the change's topic:**

- `docs/learning/lessons.md` — when you encounter a non-obvious failure mode worth preserving for future sessions (a recurring trap, a rule that prevented a reasonable-seeming mistake, a process step that turned out load-bearing). **Each lesson MUST start with this evidence-anchor table** — without anchors a "lesson" is folklore and self-improvement becomes prompt drift:

  | Field | Value |
  |---|---|
  | Surfaced by | path to `REVIEW.md` / debug log / commit / conversation that exposed the failure |
  | Reviewer findings | which CLI flagged it, severity, finding ID — e.g. `Codex 3-C1`, `Claude iter-2 IMPORTANT` |
  | Fix commit | short SHA of the commit that closed it |
  | Test added | exact test node id (or `n/a — process lesson` for review/tooling-only lessons) |
  | Behavior delta | concrete before/after — what would have happened in production without the fix; for sim/sandbox changes include the affected scenario seed / replay bundle / behavioral metric |

  Code lessons require a real test node id; only genuinely process-level lessons may use `n/a`. One concise entry per lesson; this is the source of process learnings that re-reviewers consult alongside prior `REVIEW.md` files.

**Verification step (mandatory before declaring task done):**

- Invoke the `doc-review` skill or grep for removed-API names across `docs/` and `README.md`. The audit must come back clean for the change's diff. Stale references in historical changelog / devlog / drift-log entries are intentional context and should remain — every other surface must reflect current reality.
- The multi-CLI code review must explicitly verify doc accuracy as part of its review prompt — include "verify docs in the diff match implementation; flag any stale signatures, removed APIs still mentioned, or missing coverage of new APIs in canonical guides."

**Why this is mandatory:** doc drift compounds. A single stale signature in `api-reference.md` becomes the source of truth for the next reader, then for the next feature built on top, then for an external consumer. Treating documentation as part of the change (not after the change) is the only way to keep the surface trustworthy.

### Architecture

- Respect the boundaries documented in `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`. If a boundary seems wrong, flag it instead of silently violating it.
- If architecture changes, update the relevant sections in `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`, append a row to `docs/architecture/drift-log.md`, and mention the update in the devlog.
- Do not update `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` for non-structural fixes, refactors, UI tweaks, or test-only work.
- Never delete a Key Architectural Decision in `docs/architecture/decisions.md`; add a newer decision that supersedes it.

### Devlog

- Detailed devlogs live under `docs/devlog/detailed/` as files named `START_DATE_END_DATE.md` (e.g. `2026-04-07_2026-04-13.md`).
- A new active file is created with `START_DATE == END_DATE` (today's date for both halves).
- Always append new entries to the latest detailed devlog (the file with the most recent `END_DATE`). When looking something up, start from the latest file and work backwards.
- Periodically archive: when the active file grows larger than 500 lines or a significant time boundary is reached, `git mv` the file to update its `END_DATE` to the date of its last entry, then start a new file whose `START_DATE` is today.
- After every completed task, append a detailed entry with:
  - timestamp
  - action
  - code reviewer comments, broken down by AI provider and theme as stated above
  - result
  - reasoning
  - notes
- Keep `docs/devlog/summary.md` current after updating the detailed log. Always remove outdated info. Compact when it grows larger than 50 lines.
- If a subagent handles summary work, it should extract facts only and avoid interpretation.

### Versioning

- Maintain a version number `a.b.c`:
  - Only bump `a` when the human says so.
  - Whenever you introduce a breaking change, bump `b` and reset `c`.
  - Whenever you introduce a non-breaking change, bump `c`.
- **One version bump per coherent shipped change.** If three independent features ship as three commits, each commit gets its own version bump. Do not roll multiple unrelated features into a single version.
- Maintain `docs/changelog.md` with one entry per version. Check `docs/devlog/` for context.

### Doc formatting

- Don't wrap lines. Only use a new line when you are starting a new paragraph.

## Debugging

- When debugging, use `docs/debugging/template.md` to record your process. Create a new file per debugging session and use it to iterate until you solve the problem.
- If a future session makes you realize that your previous debug sessions on the same topic did not fully solve the problem, update past docs to avoid misunderstandings.
- Clean up the temporary files (such as stack dump, test results) created during debugging after you are done.
